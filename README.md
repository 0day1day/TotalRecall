TotalRecall
===========

Based on the Volatility framework, this script will run various plugins as well as create a timeline, or use YARA/ClamAV/VirusTotal to find badness. 

Now has some sqllite DB functionality. It is being (currently) set up to run on RemNux v4. 

See the downloadable documentation for more information. This is still in BETA so bugs are (probably) rampant!
