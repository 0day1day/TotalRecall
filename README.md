===========

Based on the Volatility framework, this script will run various plugins as well as create a timeline, or use YARA/ClamAV/VirusTotal to find badness. 

Now has some sqllite DB functionality. 

See the downloadable documentation for more information. This is still in BETA so bugs are (probably) rampant!
